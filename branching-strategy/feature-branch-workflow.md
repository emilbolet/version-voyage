# Feature Branch Workflow
In the Feature Branch Workflow, all feature development takes place in a dedicated branch instead of the main or master branch. Features are merged back into the main branch once they are completed and tested.

## Pros:

- **Isolation:** Developers can work on features in isolation, without affecting the main codebase.
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on a single feature.

## Cons:

- **Merge Conflicts:** Potential for merge conflicts if features are developed in parallel for an extended period.
- **Management:** Requires diligent branch management to avoid a cluttered repository with stale branches.

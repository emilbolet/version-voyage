# GitHub Flow
A simpler alternative to Git Flow, focusing on the continuous delivery model. It primarily involves creating a branch from ``main`` (or ``master``), making changes, and then merging those changes back into the main branch after review.

## Pros:

- **Simplicity:** Less complex than Git Flow, making it easier to understand and implement.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Encourages continuous delivery by allowing changes to be integrated quickly.

## Cons:

- **Less structure:** Might not be suitable for projects that require detailed release management or have complex deployment stages.
- **Risk of Conflicts:** High chance of merge conflicts if not managed properly, especially in fast-paced development environments.

# Introduction to Trunk Based Development

Trunk Based Development (TBD) is a Git branching strategy designed for simplicity and rapid iterations, focusing on minimizing complexity and integration issues by encouraging developers to work directly in the trunk or through short-lived branches. This strategy promotes a culture of frequent integration and testing, keeping the team aligned with the latest version of the codebase.

## Core Principles of Trunk Based Development

TBD is centered around key principles:

- **Single Source of Truth**: The trunk serves as the central and most current state of the project, guiding all development activities.

- **Short-Lived Feature Branches**: Branches, when used, are kept short-lived to minimize divergence from the trunk and facilitate easy integration.

- **Frequent Commits and Merges**: Developers frequently commit their changes to the trunk, supporting early integration and continuous testing and deployment.

- **Feature Flags**: Utilized to manage in-progress or not-yet-ready features, allowing dynamic feature toggling without impacting the main codebase.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Essential for automating testing and ensuring the trunk remains in a deployable state with frequent commits.

## Benefits of Trunk Based Development

- **Improved Collaboration**: Reduces "merge hell" and enhances code quality through closer collaboration on the trunk.

- **Faster Release Cycles**: Enables rapid development, integration, and deployment of features.

- **Reduced Integration Issues**: Frequent integration simplifies maintaining a stable codebase and reduces conflict risks.

- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Allows for unblocked development of new features and fixes, independent of others' release schedules.

## Implementing Trunk Based Development

Successful implementation requires:

- **Automate Testing**: Running automated tests on every trunk commit to maintain quality and early issue detection.

- **Use Feature Flags**: Implementing feature flags to manage new functionality releases smoothly.

- **Embrace Continuous Deployment**: Setting up pipelines for automatic deployment, facilitating rapid feature delivery.

- **Encourage Small, Frequent Changes**: Promoting a culture of incremental changes and frequent integration into the trunk.

## Conclusion

Trunk Based Development offers a streamlined development and deployment path, ideal for teams focused on rapid iteration and continuous delivery. By reducing branching and merging complexity, TBD fosters collaboration and efficiency, making it suitable for agile, fast-paced development environments.
